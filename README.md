WestyRemix is a simple ecommerce site with blog, built using Remix for the front end and server, Stripe for payments, Tailwind CSS for styling, and a customized Sanity headless CMS for content and data store for orders.

This site is a rebuild of a similar site built with Gatsby, Netlify serverless functions, and Styled Components, and which uses the same Sanity project, and is used in production for a friend of mine who was in need of a simple, free way to sell his micro-roasted coffee beans.

I used this rebuild to learn Remix, practice using Typescript, and to get familiar with Tailwind.

My end goal for this site is to have a simple, all-purpose ecommerce and blog framework that anyone can populate and customize by configuring it to their own instance of the accompanying Sanity Studio template.

This repository can be used with the accompanying Sanity Studio to quickly have a simple ecommerce site up and ready to 

My goal is to have a script that can deploy an instance of this site for anyone who has a stripe and sanity account, and and place to deploy to.
